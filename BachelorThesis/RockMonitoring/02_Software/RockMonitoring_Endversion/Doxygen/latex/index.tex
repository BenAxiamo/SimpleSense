We used Libelium Waspmote as a development platform.~\newline
 In this Software documenatation are only the libraries we wrote ourselves.~\newline
 To be able to upload the code to Libelium Waspmote, the A\+PI of Libelium is necessery (see\+: \href{https://www.libelium.com/api/waspmote/index.html}{\tt Libelium Waspmote A\+PI} )~\newline
