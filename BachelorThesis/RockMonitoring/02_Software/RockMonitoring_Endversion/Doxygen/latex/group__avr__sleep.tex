\subsection{Detailed Description}

\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#include <\hyperlink{sleep_8h}{avr/sleep.h}>}
\end{DoxyCode}


Use of the {\ttfamily S\+L\+E\+EP} instruction can allow an application to reduce its power comsumption considerably. A\+VR devices can be put into different sleep modes. Refer to the datasheet for the details relating to the device you are using.

There are several macros provided in this header file to actually put the device into sleep mode. The simplest way is to optionally set the desired sleep mode using {\ttfamily set\+\_\+sleep\+\_\+mode()} (it usually defaults to idle mode where the C\+PU is put on sleep but all peripheral clocks are still running), and then call {\ttfamily sleep\+\_\+mode()}. This macro automatically sets the sleep enable bit, goes to sleep, and clears the sleep enable bit.

Example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#include <\hyperlink{sleep_8h}{avr/sleep.h}>}

...
  set\_sleep\_mode(<mode>);
  sleep\_mode();
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that unless your purpose is to completely lock the C\+PU (until a hardware reset), interrupts need to be enabled before going to sleep.

As the {\ttfamily sleep\+\_\+mode()} macro might cause race conditions in some situations, the individual steps of manipulating the sleep enable (SE) bit, and actually issuing the {\ttfamily S\+L\+E\+EP} instruction, are provided in the macros {\ttfamily \hyperlink{group__avr__sleep_ga3f159a946a8e6df0ea4d67414e9a8d87}{sleep\+\_\+enable()}}, {\ttfamily sleep\+\_\+disable()}, and {\ttfamily \hyperlink{group__avr__sleep_ga86db03d7b75cab8008152e846940e549}{sleep\+\_\+cpu()}}. This also allows for test-\/and-\/sleep scenarios that take care of not missing the interrupt that will awake the device from sleep.

Example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#include <\hyperlink{interrupt_8h}{avr/interrupt.h}>}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#include <\hyperlink{sleep_8h}{avr/sleep.h}>}

...
  set\_sleep\_mode(<mode>);
  cli();
  \textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (some\_condition)
  \{
    \hyperlink{group__avr__sleep_ga3f159a946a8e6df0ea4d67414e9a8d87}{sleep\_enable}();
    sei();
    \hyperlink{group__avr__sleep_ga86db03d7b75cab8008152e846940e549}{sleep\_cpu}();
    sleep\_disable();
  \}
  sei();
\end{DoxyCode}


This sequence ensures an atomic test of {\ttfamily some\+\_\+condition} with interrupts being disabled. If the condition is met, sleep mode will be prepared, and the {\ttfamily S\+L\+E\+EP} instruction will be scheduled immediately after an {\ttfamily S\+EI} instruction. As the intruction right after the {\ttfamily S\+EI} is guaranteed to be executed before an interrupt could trigger, it is sure the device will really be put to sleep.

Some devices have the ability to disable the Brown Out Detector (B\+OD) before going to sleep. This will also reduce power while sleeping. If the specific A\+VR device has this ability then an additional macro is defined\+: {\ttfamily sleep\+\_\+bod\+\_\+disable()}. This macro generates inlined assembly code that will correctly implement the timed sequence for disabling the B\+OD before sleeping. However, there is a limited number of cycles after the B\+OD has been disabled that the device can be put into sleep mode, otherwise the B\+OD will not truly be disabled. Recommended practice is to disable the B\+OD ({\ttfamily sleep\+\_\+bod\+\_\+disable()}), set the interrupts ({\ttfamily sei()}), and then put the device to sleep ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{group__avr__sleep_ga86db03d7b75cab8008152e846940e549}{sleep\+\_\+cpu()}}), like so\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#include <\hyperlink{interrupt_8h}{avr/interrupt.h}>}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#include <\hyperlink{sleep_8h}{avr/sleep.h}>}

...
  set\_sleep\_mode(<mode>);

  \textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (some\_condition)
  \{
    \hyperlink{group__avr__sleep_ga3f159a946a8e6df0ea4d67414e9a8d87}{sleep\_enable}();
    sleep\_bod\_disable();
    sei();
    \hyperlink{group__avr__sleep_ga86db03d7b75cab8008152e846940e549}{sleep\_cpu}();
    sleep\_disable();
  \}
  sei();
\end{DoxyCode}

Put the device into sleep mode. The SE bit must be set beforehand, and it is recommended to clear it afterwards. \index{$<$avr/sleep.\+h$>$\+: Power Management and Sleep Modes@{$<$avr/sleep.\+h$>$\+: Power Management and Sleep Modes}!sleep\+\_\+enable@{sleep\+\_\+enable}}

Put the device in sleep mode. How the device is brought out of sleep mode depends on the specific mode selected with the set\+\_\+sleep\+\_\+mode() function. See the data sheet for your device for more details.
